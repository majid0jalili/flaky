    Fix a flaky reftest, which became worse after recent firefox changes (#12038)
    
    The test has always been async (ready is called asynchronously) but for
    some reason it wasn't noticeable until now, where apparently some firefox
    changes make the timing issue happen more often.

    Always sends headers to disable caching in tests (#10701)
    
    I observed browser tests being flaky due to the iframe HTML (a.html)
    sometimes being cached by the browser. This was happening because
    no-cache headers were only being sent for some resources. This
    changes the test harness server to always specify no caching.
    
    I've observed this bring down the flakiness of the test_modularize
    suite from failing overall 50-70% of the time to failing 0% of the time,
    consistently, on Safari and Firefox.
    
    I also removed the unneeded Expires header since the browsers
    used in testing are modern enough to only need the standard
    Cache-Control header.

    Browser test improvements (#9208)
    
    Remove the @flaky annotation, which used to run annotated tests up to 3 times. Instead, since the problem is more widespread (any timing issue on the CI VMs can make a test fail), let each browser test run twice before failing it.
    
    This is an optimization over @flaky - that ran the whole test again. This just runs the browser portion, so it avoids duplicate building.
    
    Standardizes the timeout to 60s. This should avoid more flakiness.
    
    Fixes the glgears_long test, apparently our bots now can reach only 20fps (not sure what changed there..)?

    Mark as flaky some graphics tests. These have always been flaky but recently the frequency of all 3 has increased a bunch. Could be the firefox update. (#9008)

    Fix one flakiness issue in browser.test_chunked_synchronous_xhr (#9003)
    
    The test is marked @flaky which runs it up to 3 times to try to avoid a random error. But we never shut down the server, so the second and later runs would just hit an error on trying to create a server on the same port. (Of course not shutting down the server was bad for other reasons too!)
    
    Hopefully this will decrease dramatically the number of random failures on this test, but it won't eliminate them entirely.

    mark two tests as flaky (#8866)
    
    These seem to be common enough in recent runs to justify retrying.

    Get most chrome browser tests running (#7375)
    
    * use new KeyboardEvent(), as event.initKeyEvent was deprecated and removed from chrome
    
    * remove dump() calls
    
    * mark a test as no-chrome
    
    * add a mechanism to manually run a reftest, for tests that are async
    
    * xvfb fixes: show the log, and automatically find a port, so that another invocation during the emrun test succeeds
    
    * add some debugging code for browser tests
    
    * update sdl2 port to version_15, which brings in a fix for egl error reporting on context creation failure (which happens on chrome on ci sometimes)
    
    * browser test improvements: mark pthread_sbrk as flaky, mark two more tests that need a manual reftest trigger, and avoid creating an sdl2 renderer if we don't need one in some tests
    
    * more reference slack for browser.test_sdl2_gfx
    
    * mark browser.test_sdl2_mouse as flaky - the errors there appear to just be random weirdness on headless chrome's side
