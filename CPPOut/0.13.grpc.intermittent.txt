    Fixed intermittent CPP sync server shutdown leak.
    
    Specifically: if a request handling thread is in flight but scheduled
    out when shutdown is called on the server, but it has already passed
    the shutdown check, then when it resumes it will add a grpc_call to
    the completion queue that is leaked. We fix this by explicitly freeing
    such calls after all worker threads have shutdown.
    
    To manifest the leak, run the end2end::ClientCancelsRequestStream
    test repeatedly on the unpatched server implementation. About 0.5% of
    the time, the leak will manifest.

    Use an unsigned pointer compare, as the highest bit may sometimes be set.
    
    This fixes intermittent connection issues on 32-bit Linux. Also related
    to issues #2557 and #2600.
