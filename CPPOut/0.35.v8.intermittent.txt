    [wasm] Fix JumpTableAssembler corrupting surrounding code.
    
    We instantiate the JumpTableAssembler in patching mode (i.e. directly on
    existing code without an intermittent buffer). In this mode it is not
    possible to record reloc information. This makes sure we no longer just
    blindly write into the non-existing buffer.

    [wasm] Do not used "undefined" for function signature padding.
    
    Commit d0b8e7fb introduced some functionality to allocate additional
    space in the function table, filled with an "undefined" function
    signature. Use -1 instead of undefined_value() as the latter can have
    the top bits cleared (which happens often for arm64) and causes
    intermittent test failures.

    Stop profiler on isolate teardown if still running
    
    If the profiler is started via the API and not stopped, V8 will
     intermittently crash during isolate teardown.
    
    The fix is to run the DeleteAllProfiles function in Isolate::Deinit()
     if cpu_profiler_ still exists.

    A64: Fix r19474: Tidy up Push and Pop TODOs.
    
    This fixes some snapshot=off, debug-mode regressions.
    
      - Call CheckConstPool when entering InsturctionAccurateScopes. This
        fixes a problem in PushMultipleTimes where 'count' is very high.
        Each call to PushHelper starts an InstructionAccurateScope
        immediately after the last one finishes, with no opportunity for the
        constant pool to be generated.
    
      - Temporarily disable AssertStackConsistency in PrepareForPush. This
        assertion seems to push the code size too far, and several cctests
        (intermittently) fail due to buffer size limitations. I would like
        to renable this assertion later.

    Fix test-log/EquivalenceOfLoggingAndTraversal
    
    The test has been marked as intermittently failing since 2011 and since that "code-creation" event signature has changed a bit. I updated the parser in the test but that revealed another issue: "code-creation" events with type 'Script' didn't match functions with type 'LazyCompile' retrieved during the heap traversal because the later had name " :1:1" which didn't match the script's name.

    Fix FindSharedFunctionInfoInScript to not optimize.
    
    This prevents a corner case in FindSharedFunctionInfoInScript that would cause
    functions to be optimized because an intermittent GC would clear the flag
    indicating whether breakpoints are present. Above method was also moved into the
    Debug class because it is only used by the debugger.
