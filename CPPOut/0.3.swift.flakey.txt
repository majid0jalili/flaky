    Set CPU Device Count from environment variable in tests. (#23629)
    
    The initialization order between _ExecutionContext and _RuntimeConfig is not
    guaranteed, which makes the tests flakey.

    [build-script] Re-enable lldb unit tests in PR testing.
    
    This have been disabled because they were flakey, but now we
    should have fixed the issues (or if there's something outstanding,
    well, it's the right time to fix).
    
    This is getting more important as we want to increase the set
    of `lit/` or `unittest`-style testcases.
