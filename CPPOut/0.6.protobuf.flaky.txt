    Mark iOS tests as able to fail.
    
    Travis updated their images to include an xctool that can randomly kill
    tests, so mark them as flaky to avoid turning things red.

    Update the min toolchain for iOS/OS X to be Xcode 7
    
    - Let Xcode update the projects, schemes, and info.plists.
    - Add workaround for shallow analyzer issues in current Xcode versions (deep analyze gets things correct).
    - Tweak the Swift based tests to avoid warnings from Xcode 7's XCTest using optionals for autoenclosure results.
    - No longer tag the ObjC iOS travis test as flaky, xctool seems to manage the simulator pretty well.
