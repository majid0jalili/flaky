    AsyncServerSocket: more tries for binding to a port
    
    Summary: User reports of intermittent failures at 5.  Setting up a server is expensive.  Binding to a socket is pretty cheap.  Why not 25 tries?  Why not 100?
    
    Test Plan: hope

    Migrating folly to gcc-4.7.1
    
    Summary:
    folly/PLATFORM is the last fbcode platform on gcc-4.6.2.
    
    Before pushing, I ran arc unit from my devserver (see Test Plan).
    Phabricator's test run has a lot of aborted test cases, which are
    indicative of a failing test framework. Arc unit had been
    intermittently broken when running my own tests. Overriding
    Phabricator's unit test failures:
    @override-unit-failures
    
    Test Plan:
    (1) fbconfig -r folly/ -- build and runtsts in dbg and opt.
    
    Everything is passing.
    
    (2) arc unit, look at each failed result
    
    Some builds/tests are failing. Most seem unrelated. Of the rest, one is
    also failing on master, and the others did not fail during a second run.

    Fix intermittent failure in concurrent_skip_list_test
    
    Summary: It creates too many threads, stop when we run out of resources.
    
    Test Plan: by hand, in a loop, in a memory-constrained environment
