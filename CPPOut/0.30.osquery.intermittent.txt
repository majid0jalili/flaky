    Increase block period in flaky BufferedForwarder test (#2222)
    
    This test was intermittently failing because it relies on the actual thread
    scheduling. Our discussion in issue #2218 decided that it was worth keeping the
    test around, while trying to mitigate the flakiness. The longer sleeps in this
    test ran successfully hundreds of times in local testing.
