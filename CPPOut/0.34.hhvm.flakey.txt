    Hack tests should always show diffs in sandcastle
    
    Summary:
    The ancient Chinese military philosopher Sun Tzu wrote "if you know yourself but not your enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat". [The Art of War, Sun Tzu, Spring and Autumn Period]. Our enemy is flakey tests.
    
    A more modern military philosopher Career Sergeant Zim said "The enemy cannot pull a trigger if you've disabled his hand" [Starship Troopers, Robert Heinlein, 1959].
    
    https://pxl.cl/fC3c
    
    Look at that picture. There was a flakey test failure. We don't know what went wrong. Verify.py suggests to run `./hphp/hack/test/review.sh` to review the failures, but our hand has been disabled (by virtue of the test being run on sandcastle).
    
    SOLUTION: whenever verify.py runs on sandcastle, it should display diffs.

    Another cause of flakey LSP tests
    
    Summary:
    Each LSP integration tests attempts to start hh_server, wait until it's responsive as indicated by "hh check" returning "No errors\!" within 20 one-second retries, then allows 500ms to establish a persistent connection with it, and then enters in dialog over that persistent connection.
    
    The previous diff addressed cases (observed in sandcastle but not in testing) where hh_server simply failed to start, by simply skipping the test in this case. I believe that hh_server might fail to start in cases where the machine is overloaded or out of memory.
    
    The current diff addresses cases where the machine is so busy that hh_server isn't able to establish a persistent connection within 500ms. In these cases we'll get back the message "Server busy". Again, we simply skip over the test.
    
    We might consider changing it to do retries. But that will only delay the question -- what if it's still busy after 10 retries? after 20? after 2 days? The only good answer is to skip the test if hh_server isn't responsive enough.
    
    (We don't generally observe hh_server being unresponsive. If it is, I trust it will be caught fine in other situations).

    Address flakey lsp integration test
    
    Summary:
    I got reports that the lsp integration tests are consistently failing. Inside `test_hover`, it calls `prepare_environment`, which calls `self.check_cmd(...)`, which attempts to launch `hh check`. But it's getting back this on stderr:
    
       Error: Ran out of retries, giving up\!
    
    I figure the job of the lsp integration tests is to test lsp. If we can't spin up hh, well, that shouldn't report as a failure of LSP.
    
    This diff detects that situation and skips the test.

    Make ext_watchman test only alert devx_www
    
    Summary:
    FACEBOOK
    
    The ext_watchman test is a bit flakey but I'm having trouble repro'ing this. I suspect the problems are transient external failures relating to Watchman which I can't really control. After multiple hours of running in a loop on my devserver I got one failure which was of this nature.
    
    This diff introduces a Faebook-only test which runs the real/open-source ext_watchman test but always returns "pass". All failures are instead reported directly to devx_www by creating/bumping a task. This way we can figure what's going on if there is a consistent problem without bothing the HHVM team. The original/open-source test can still run independently but we will disable it in Sandcastle internally.

    Fix a flakey test
    
    Summary:
    The test writes, then includes a php file. The test is also configured
    to run multiple times (via --count=10). Our devservers have
    millisecond resolution for file times, so if we did better than 1ms
    per iteration, we could end up picking up the old file from the file
    cache.
    
    Apparently, we've been optimizing interp times, because this test
    started failing regularly in the last release.
    
    Fix it by using a different name for each iteration.

    Summary: This should fix some crashes and all bad tests other than 014, and 028.
    
    I marked test 014 as flakey, as it is checking for wrong return values due to a bug in PHP.  It appears as though PHP is using the resource number as the factorial rather than the resource's value, giving unpridictable results (depends on how many resources have been used thus far)

    Separate flakey from clowny tests
    
    Summary: - add --flakey option to run them anyway
     - make it so you don't need to blow away framework_downloads/WHATEVER every time you remove something from the flakeylist/clownlist/blacklist or add --flakey
    
    The idea is that we will still run flakey tests for the charts on hhvm.com/frameworks/ , but we won't include them in our commit-blocking test runs.

    Destructor timing makes this test just everso-slighty

    Move the close to the end and it'll always happen in the right order.
    
    Also change expectf "finalised" to "finali%ced" to
    account for libsqlit3's switch from Brittish English to American English.
    Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way... Ugh.

    small framework runner changes
    
    - Put a newline before the downloading message as it happened in the middle of the line a bunch of times
    - Made the comparing message less verbose since it is printed all the time on every runner
    - Renamed it "run" and made it execuatble (in line with `test/run`)
    - Fixed a warning where the status is empty. Is that right to ignore it?
    - Don't always generate `.expect` files
    - Similarly, don't always generate the summary file. I don't really understand what you are trying to do with that one being checked in?
    
    I don't really understand how to use this yet. My runs don't seem to give me the thumbs up, so either the expect files are too specific to @JoelMarcey's machine or the tests are flakey. Either way, we can't use this yet.

    Fix and re-enable a number of "flakey" tests
    
    None of these tests are fundamentally flakey - there
    is just a danger of port collision (some had already been fixed
    before they were disabled). Appropriate retries - and suppression
    of warnings for the intermediate failures - should be sufficient to
    make them solid.
