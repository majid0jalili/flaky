    Remove an assertion in FlushAfterIntraL0CompactionCheckConsistencyFail (#7003)
    
    Summary:
    FlushAfterIntraL0CompactionCheckConsistencyFail is flakey. It sometimes fails with:
    
    db/db_compaction_test.cc:5186: Failure
    Expected equality of these values:
      10
      NumTableFilesAtLevel(0)
        Which is: 3
    
    I don't see a clear reason why the assertion would always be true. The necessarily of the assertion is not clear either. Remove it.

    Test Plan: See the test still builds.

    Try to fix DBSSTTest.RateLimitedDelete flakiness (#4840)
    
    Summary:
    DBSSTTest.RateLimitedDelete is flakey. The root cause is not completely identified, but
    the compaction waiting in the test doesn't strictly wait for compaction cleaning to finish, which
    may cause test flakiness. Fix it first and see whether the failures still happen.

    Improve ttl_test
    
    Summary:
    Our valgrind tests are failing because ttl_test is kind of flakey. This diff should fix valgrind issue and make ttl_test less flakey and much faster.
    
    Instead of relying on Env::Default() for getting current time, I expose `Env*` to all TTL functions that are interested in time. That way, I can insert a custom test Env which is then used to provide exactly the times we need. That way, we don't need to sleep anymore -- we control the time.
    
    Test Plan: ttl_test in normal and valgrind run

    Make CompactionInputErrorParanoid less flakey
    
    Summary:
    I'm getting lots of e-mails with CompactionInputErrorParanoid failing. Most recent example early morning today was: http://ci-builds.fb.com/job/rocksdb_valgrind/562/consoleFull
    
    I'm putting a stop to these e-mails. I investigated why the test is flakey and it turns out it's because of non-determinsim of compaction scheduling. If there is a compaction after the last flush, CorruptFile will corrupt the compacted file instead of file at level 0 (as it assumes). That makes `Check(9, 9)` fail big time.
    
    I also saw some errors with table file getting outputed to >= 1 levels instead of 0. Also fixed that.
    
    Test Plan: Ran corruption_test 100 times without a failure. Previously it usually failed at 10th occurrence.

    Fix GetProperty() test
    
    Summary:
    GetProperty test is flakey.
    Before this diff: P8635927
    After: P8635945
    
    We need to make sure the thread is done before we destruct sleeping tasks. Otherwise, bad things happen.

    [CF] Make LogDeletionTest less flakey
    
    Summary: Retry GetSortedWalFiles() and also wait 20ms before counting number of log files. WaitForFlush() doesn't necessarily wait for logs to be deleted, since logs are deleted outside of the mutex.
