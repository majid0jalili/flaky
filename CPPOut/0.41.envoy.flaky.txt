    Windows: Enable direct_response_integration_test (#12772)
    
    - The test is flaky without performing socket shutdown
      - We know the content is fully written and the filter is a terminal
        one so we can enable the connection to be half closed and shut down
        the write end
      - Otherwise, the read in the client can get a connection reset error
        and on Windows may not have received all the data it should
      - See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-shutdown#remarks
        - `To assure that all data is sent and received on a connected
          socket before it is closed, an application should use shutdown to
          close connection before calling closesocket.`
    - Also enables route_fuzz_test and echo_integration_test as they now
      compile and pass

    test: Fix watcher_impl_test on Windows (#12496)
    
    - Tests that used a non-blocking libevent event loop are flaky on
       Windows (and would be flaky on other platforms if event notifications
       routinely took longer to be propagated) since the event loop could exit
       before an event notification. Switching to use a blocking event loop
       prevents early exit before filesystem events are evaluated.
    - Skip SymlinkAtomicRename test as Windows does not have an atomic file
       move API that can move a directory/symlink where the new name is a non-empty
       existing directory/symlink (MoveFileEx can atomically replace a file
       with a file, however).

    tests: tag tests that fail on Windows with fails_on_windows (#10940)
    
    * 139 tests tagged in total now, a few of which are flaky and don't fail every
      invocation
    * To enable contributors are to work on fixing these failed tests and to give
      a view into what progress still needs to be made
    * When we are able to get CI working to build/run tests on Windows, we
      can ignore the tagged tests and untag them as they are fixed
    * It appears a large portion of the tests will be fixable with a few patches
    * there are also assumptions in test setup/teardown etc. that are not
      compatible with Windows at the moment
    * a large percentage of the failing tests are integration tests

    * test: ban RegisterFactory in most tests
    
    Allows the integration test filters and clusters to be statically

    Otherwise tests should use the InjectFactory helper.
    
    Adds code format check for RegisterFactory and REGISTER_FACTORY used
    outside the whitelisted files. Removes use of both from all other
    tests.
    
    Also disables flaky test mode since we think the problems are

    fuzz: make temporary path and port handling less flaky for server fuz… (#4202)
    
    * Avoid reusing temporary paths across tests.
    
    * Force port zero binding on server_fuzz_test.
    
    * Force server_fuzz_test not to write access log to random places on FS.
    
    I don't think this is the last we'll see on the server_fuzz_test flake test, since this particular
    fuzz test is inherently non-hermetic. So, this seems to be the high payoff whackamole for now.

    network: fixing a bug in detecting closed connections (#3813)
    
    As documented in #3785, we had a disconnect test flaking out because the ECONNRESET was being overwritten by EAGAIN in the logging code, so the ECONNRESET was not properly handled and the test hung. This represents an actual Envoy bug where an inopportune log flush can mask a connection close. Presumably the same issue exists on the write path.
