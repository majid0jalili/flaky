      Fixes #19853
    
      I investigated the issue in #19876 and I still intend to fix the underlying issue of a race when using wallet RPCs right after starting a node in that PR. However, since that is a bit more complicated than I initially thought it makes sense to merge the fix of the test so the intermittent test failures stop. This fix in the test is going to be needed, either way, #19876 will only provide an error where before it was reporting a false balance.

      This mitigates https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15400
    
      I had a look into the issue today and this seems to be the best we can do given that the root causes some unexpected custom error code from the macOS kernel that python/asyncio doesn't know how to handle properly yet.

    Reimplement click-to-pay links. Add OSX support.
    
    Switch to using Qt's QLocalServer/QLocalSocket to handle bitcoin
    payment links (bitcoin:... URIs)
    
    Reason for switch: the boost::interprocess mechanism seemed flaky,
    and doesn't mesh as well with "The Qt Way"
    
    qtipcserver.cpp/h is replaced by paymentserver.cpp/h
    
    Click-to-pay now also works on OSX, with a custom Info.plist
    that registers Bitcoin-Qt as a handler for bitcoin: URLs and
    an event listener on the main QApplication that handles
    QFileOpenEvents (Qt translates 'url clicked' AppleEvents into
    QFileOpenEvents automagically).
