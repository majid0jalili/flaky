    azure: rerun the flaky tests automatically (#12655)
    
    Added the build flag to enable rerunning the failed flaky tests as brought up by #12358. This is separated from the additional logic to post-process the test output to prevent rollbacks and improve quality of life of envoy devs.
    Deflaker posts messages on Slack channel for flakey tests.

    test: fix flakey listener_impl_test (#9132)
    
    The DisableAndEnableListener test creates a real listener and client
    connection to test listener enable/disable functionality. Prior to
    was not accepted by a disabled listener within 2 seconds. After #7165,
    the timer and sleep execute against an `Event::SimulatedTimeSystem`
    (e.g. the sleep call increments simulated time and the timer fires
    almost immediately). The timer event closes the client connection. If
    that occurs before the listener has a pending connection, the
    subsequent `listener.enable()` call does not trigger
    `listener.onAccept` and the test times out. This seems to happen
    primarily on macOS, though in principal the race exists on Linux as
    well. However, it may be that in practice localhost connections in
    Linux are rarely or never deferred.

    fuzz: remove test/server/server_corpus/oom-550f56d376b3a23320724b98c79905f7c73e4e55. (#3319)
    
    This was hanging the CI in a flakey way. Seems dangerous to be reading
    runtime from / even with the various safeguards (recursion depth, /dev
    exclusion) that we've added. We can probably skip this one for now, if
    it shows up in ClusterFuzz again, we can figure out something more
    robust as a regression.

    test: fix integration test flake. (#1389)
    
    testEquivalent() was comparing two responses, both of which had a date: header with real time at
    second granularity. When this straddled a second boundary, the test would fail, resulting in flakey
    tests.
