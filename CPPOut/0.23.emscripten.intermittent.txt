    Add debugging logic to browser.test_offset_converter (#10539)
    
    Helps #10232. I can't reproduce that intermittent failure locally,
    so this PR adds some logging that should at least narrow down
    what the cause could be. It's pretty minimal logging so seems
    harmless to land and then when the failure happens we'll get
    more info then.

    Avoid spamming the console with DEMANGLE_SUPPORT suggestions (#8720)
    
    The suggestion to flip that option on is helpful, but it should not be emitted from a function that may not be writing to the console at all.
    
    Writing it to the output of that function is an option, but it may break stack trace parsing, so seems risky.
    
    Instead, I added more docs for this in the debugging section.
    
    This should fix an odd intermittent error on emscripten-releases ci on other.test_fflush-fs - the warning is printed to the console there, messing up the output. I'm not totally sure why it gets emitted there, but when I realized we shouldn't even be emitting this, I figured it's faster to just remove it.
