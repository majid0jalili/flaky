    [Archetype builder] Improve crash diagnostics for nondeterministic failure.
    
    The assertion
    
      "Potential archetype mapping differs from representative!"
    
    keeps popping up intermittently but has been frustratingly hard to
    reproduce. When we do catch it (as CI seems to do often "enough"),
    dump all of the relevant information to aid in debugging.

    [overlay] A tentative fix for the intermittent build failures.
    
    It looks from the failed build logs that XCTest has a transitive
    dependency on CoreMedia, so listing this dependency explicitly might
    solve the problem.

    ClangImporter: Provide a null SourceLocation when lexing NS_ENUM token.
    
    Using the expansionLoc intermittently leads to an "offset overflow", and we don't really care about the token source location.
