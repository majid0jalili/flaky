    Unit tests: reduce the flakiness of loading progress tests.
    
    For whatever reason, swapping the order with the render() tests solve the
    intermittent random failures. Also, split the tests between loading
    start and finish checks (to better recognize which one is failing, if
    there is a failure), also make the tests more asynchoronous.
