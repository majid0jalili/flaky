    refactor(main): Extract SDL window initialization & management into separate class (#4472)
    
    * Move SDL_Window setup from main in to a standalone class
    
    Tested, working. Only behavior change so far is moving the window loading up in the load order in an attempt to get visual to the user as quickly as possible.
    I modeled the new class after how the Audio class is handled.
    
    * Update GameWindow.cpp
    
    Added comments. Moved code to more logical order of operations. Removed the Win32 exception on cleanup operations. Added explicit call to hardware acceleration.
    
    * Update project.pbxproj
    
    Thanks to @Fzzr for testing on Mac and providing an updated XCode project file.
    
    * Cleanup unused MonitorHz
    
    Minor edits. Ignore the .gitignore
    
    * Make it unchanged.
    
    Remove my edit.
    
    * Comment editing for readability
    
    This makes more sense to a noob.
    
    * Update in response to feedback
    
    * Resolve issues introduced with that last patch
    
    Missing (), and missing ;
    Forgot to update my .h file
    
    * New module missing
    
    You will need these if compiliing on Windows.
    
    * Fix fullscreen regression
    
    Move comment to own line
    Remove old comment
    Add missing whitespace
    
    * Remove commented code
    
    * style: reorder methods, includes
