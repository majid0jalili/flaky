    watchman: revert docusaurus docs changes
    
    Summary:
    This reverts the website dir back to the state prior to D20623790 (https://github.com/facebook/watchman/commit/fccc57f6243e81d39be2cda24f3b856c0e254332)
    
    We've had a lot of trouble around the migration and are spending a lot of
    time trying to dig in and understand why it's not working out and it
    simply isn't a good use of time right now.
    
    We can re-evaluate migrating to docusaurus once it has stabilized some more.

    Migration of docs to Docusaurus (#788)
    
    Summary:
    ## Motivation
    
    Hello there, as discussed in https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/787  we would like to dogfood docusaurus v2 for watchman. The development experience for v2 is much better because client side rendering is also enabled. The website is also seems to be very performant (its a single page app now but also staticly rendered for SEO)
    
    ## Demo

    import libart as a third party dependency
    
    Summary: pulling in the BSD licensed Adaptive Radix Tree implementation
    from https://github.com/armon/libart.git at the current head revision

    I didn't include its bundled dependency on check; I will port its tests
    to use our test infrastructure in the following diff that integrates
    it into our build system.
