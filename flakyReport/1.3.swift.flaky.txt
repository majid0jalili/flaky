    [TypeChecker] NFC: Clarify flaky diagnostic XFAIL
    
    Instead of XFAILing whole `test/Constraints/operator.swift`
    let's adjust diagnostic responsible for flakiness.

    Fix flaky Driver tests
    
    Several Driver tests create a hard link to the compiler in a temporary directory, then invoke it thorugh that hard link to see how it locates items in the resource directory. This pattern can tickle a system-load-dependent macOS bug involving invocations of freshly-created hard links, causing rare test failures in CI or on contributorsâ€™ machines.
    
    This change avoids the OS bug by always copying instead of hard linking. We already fall back to copying on Windows, so all tests should pass with a copy anyway. Removing this workaround will be tracked by rdar://problem/53507844.

    [silgen] Add a test for objc factory constructors.
    
    While updating DI for ownership, I noticed that we were closing a borrow scope too early in the DI version of this test file. While trying to find why I missed it earlier, I noticed that (AFAICT) we don't have a specific SILGen test for this behavior.
    
    This commit adds the missing test with the ownership verifier disabled. I am
    going to fix it in a subsequent commit.

    Move test/SILOptimizer files to reflect lib/SILOptimizer.

    Use the 'self consumed' analysis to eliminate releases of consumed self
    
    Previously, SILGen would store a null pointer into the self box upon
    encountering a constructor delegation that consumes self. This was a
    constant source of bugs. Now, use the new analysis to make this use
    DI information instead, emitting an extra bit at runtime if necessary.
    
    Also re-organize the DI tests for initializers, and add CHECK: lines
    instead of just asserting we don't crash or diagnose.
