    Fix minor test-specific intermittent failures (#2748)
    
    * Fix intermittent failures in websocket.active_difficulty test
    
    * Fix intermittent failures in websocket.bootstrap_exited test due to attempt finishing immediately
    
    * Fix work_watcher.propagate by allowing higher max work generation difficulty
    
    * Apply similar fix to node_telemetry.remove_peer_different_genesis_udp as the tcp version in https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/2738
    
    * Move node_telemetry.all_peers_use_single_request_cache to slow_tests as it takes too long
    
    * Fix intermittent failure in active_transactions.activate_dependencies due to the election being removed before full cementing (still in conf height processor)
    
    * Don't check network size, peers are added for exclusion but they can still reconnect via UDP; explicitly request telemetry to make the test faster (UDP does not request telemetry on connection

    Fix system.generate_send_new intermittent failures (#2742)
    
    This is likely due to wallet rep counts not updating quick enough on CI due to online weight fluctuating very heavily in this test, causing votes to not be generated. Waiting for the online weight to stabilize by waiting on a voting rep should fix it.
    
    Ran CI twice and didn't trigger whereas it would trigger often without this change.
