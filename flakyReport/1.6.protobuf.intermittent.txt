    Attempt to mitigate "docker pull" failures
    
    Lots of CI tests have been failing recently with error messages like
    this from "docker pull":
    
      Error response from daemon: unexpected EOF
    
    This seems to be an issue affecting other projects as well:
    https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-pull-causes-error-response-from-daemon-unexpected-eof/88608
    
    This commit tries to mitigate the problem by periodically retrying
    failed Docker pulls.
