    More transactional lock related changes. Removed the read transaction, so
    that read and update share the same transactions. Fix an issue that
    prevents old version data being returned, so that MVCC works on memcached
    channel. Also consolidate connection init functions for simplicity.

    Resolve synchronization issues for concurrent execution of memcached commands
    from multiple sessions. Mostly related to interaction of "flush_all"
    command (truncate table) and other DML operations.

    disconnects when test servers are put under load

    WL#3337 (Event scheduler new architecture)
    Cleaned up the code a bit. Fixed few leaks.
    This code still does not load events on server startup
    from disk. The problem is that there is a need for a THD instance, which
    does not exist during server boot. This will be solved soon.
    Still Event_timed is used both for the memory queue and for exectution.
    This will be changed according to WL#3337 probably in the next commit.

    fix for bug #17619 Scheduler race conditions
    - Scheduler is either initialized at server start or never.
      Starting & stopping is now suspending & resuming.
    - The scheduler has clear OO interface
    - Now all calls to the scheduler are synchronous
    - GLOBAL event_scheduler uses thd::sys_var_tmp (see set_var.cc)
    - External API is encapsulated into class Events
    - Includes fixes for all comments of Kostja's review of 19.05.2005
    
    Starting to merge into 5.1-release (5.1.10) and push

     - removed the mit-pthreads subdirectory on Monty's request (mit-pthreads
       is now available as a separate downloadable tarball instead)
     - modified the RPM spec file according to discussions with Monty, Jani,
       Heikki and David (corrected build options, updated Packager tag)

    slave master.info FILE -> IO_CACHE
    send_file() is more stack-friendly - changed large static buffer to alloc_root()
    fixed my_b_seek() to work with WRITE_CACHE
    test case to make sure the slave starts correctly after being stopped
    truncated words file so the replication tests will take less time
