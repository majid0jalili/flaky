    WL#8795: EVALUATE DEFAULTS SET BY MTR AND CHANGE THEM TO USE SERVER DEFAULTS
             WHERE POSSIBLE
    
    Description:
    ============
    mysql-test-run.pl (MTR) has a configuration file mysql-test/include/default_mysqld.cnf
    which sets values for various server variables. Some of them maybe needed to run tests
    with limited resources available on PB2, while some others maybe there due to legacy
    reasons that are not valid anymore.
    
    The settings made by MTR were evaluated to assess whether they were needed. Then,
    the setting of variables to non-server-default values were removed from default_mysqld.cnf.
    The tests run by MTR were modified or recorded accordingly.

    WL#9071: Remove mysql_install_db and server --bootstrap option
    
    This patch has three logical parts:
    
    1. Remove the 'mysql_install_db' executable and all references to it from
       elsewhere. Remove associated MTR tests, unit tests, comments mentioning
       it, as well as additional source code used only by that executable.
    
       Rewrite 'scripts/mysqld_multi.sh' to use 'mysqld --initialize' rather
       than 'mysql_install_db'.
    
       Note: Usage of 'mysql_install_db' from MySQL Cluster test environment
             will be fixed by  Cluster devs outside the scope of this WL.
    
    2. Remove the deprecated '--bootstrap' option, and the '--install-server'
       option (which has not been released). Replace the variables
       representing these options by the variable representing the
       '--initialize' option.
    
       Update or remove tests and scripts referring to these variables.
    
    3. Remove support for MTR_VERSION=1. This is dependent on the
       deprecated '--bootstrap' option, and is therefore removed.

    This patch switches all mysys/ files from .c to .cc.
    By doing this we get stricter compile checks (e.g. type checks)
    and it makes it possible to use C++ features for future
    bug fixes and extensions inside mysys.

    Bug#16629996: Remove more unused #ifdefs
    
    Additional patch.
    
    This patch removes the following #ifdefs which were never set:
    - DONT_HAVE_TO_BE_INITALIZED
    - HAVE_AIOWAIT
    - HAVE_CLOSE_SERVER_SOCK
    - HAVE_CRYPTED_FRM
    - HAVE_DARWIN_THREADS
    - HAVE_EMBEDDED_PRIVILEGE_CONTROL
    - HAVE_FILE_VERSIONS

    - HAVE_LINUXTHREADS
    - HAVE_SETUPTERM
    - HAVE_SYS_VADVICE_H
    - HAVE_TIME
    - HAVE_VIDATTR
    
    This patch also removes #ifdefs HAVE_FTIME and HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H.
    According to the man page about ftime "This function is obsolete.
    Don't use it". Including the header file gave compilation warnings
    on FreeBSD. The one remaining use of ftime() has been replaced
    with gettimeofday().

    More transactional lock related changes. Removed the read transaction, so
    that read and update share the same transactions. Fix an issue that
    prevents old version data being returned, so that MVCC works on memcached
    channel. Also consolidate connection init functions for simplicity.

    WL#3337 (Event scheduler new architecture)
    Cleaned up the code a bit. Fixed few leaks.
    This code still does not load events on server startup
    from disk. The problem is that there is a need for a THD instance, which
    does not exist during server boot. This will be solved soon.
    Still Event_timed is used both for the memory queue and for exectution.
    This will be changed according to WL#3337 probably in the next commit.

    fix for bug #17619 Scheduler race conditions
    - Scheduler is either initialized at server start or never.
      Starting & stopping is now suspending & resuming.
    - The scheduler has clear OO interface
    - Now all calls to the scheduler are synchronous
    - GLOBAL event_scheduler uses thd::sys_var_tmp (see set_var.cc)
    - External API is encapsulated into class Events
    - Includes fixes for all comments of Kostja's review of 19.05.2005
