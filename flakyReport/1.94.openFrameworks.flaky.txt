    Android Windows missing zip fix
    
    Fixes #2997
    
    Adds a `windows/` folder to
    `libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/android/`
    Which includes the required files for
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm
    - zip.exe
    - bzip2.dll
    - zip32z64.dll
    
    Modifications have been made to `config.android.default.mk` for windows
    to point to the zip in the directory to compress the resources.
    
    - Tested on Windows 7 with master / Eclipse
    - Tested on OSX / Eclipse
