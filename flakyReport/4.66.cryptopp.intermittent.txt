    Fix compile on old PowerPC
    This cleans up the compile on old PwerMac G5's. Our Altivec and Crypto code relies on Power7 and Power8 extensions. There's no need to shoehorn Altivec and Power4 into old platforms, so we disable Altivec and Crypto unless Power7 is available. The GNUmakefile sets CRYPTOPP_DISABLE_ALTIVEC if Power7 is not available.
