    Assimp FBX Import support
    
    Issues fixed:
    - Updated assimp to latest and backported fixes into godot.
    - Fixed file scale being ignored from FBX file.
    - Fixed bone removal
    - Implemented proper armature binding
    - Fixed recursion not always going through the entire path
    - Implemented assimp global scaling system
    - Fixed assimp global scale process to support unit conversion
    - Implemented proper fbx scaling
    - Fixed asserts caused by missing faces in some models which could crash
    - Fixed valid bone removal
    - Fixed root node being overwriten by assimp which caused data loss
    - Fixed armature construction so that it works with multiple roots
    - Implemented basic support for FBX standard materials
    - Refactoring to improve code quality and improve function reuse.
    - Simplified node creation from assimp scene into subsections: create_light, create_mesh, create_bone.
    - Creating meshes is now done after hierarchy is created so that the skeleton is always available.
    - Added support to assimp to support file scale in all formats which call SetFileScale.
    - Many other fixes provided into assimp.
    
    Known issues:
    - FBX pivots from Maya do not currently work. (workaround: for now use blender import and export to remove pivot tracks)
    - Hierarchy creates an extra node for each mesh - this was done intentionally but we intended to do a pass to remove these as they're a required node.
    - When an animated mesh has not executed any animation the rest pose is wrong.
