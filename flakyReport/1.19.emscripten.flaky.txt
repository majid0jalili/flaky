    Browser test improvements (#9208)
    
    Remove the @flaky annotation, which used to run annotated tests up to 3 times. Instead, since the problem is more widespread (any timing issue on the CI VMs can make a test fail), let each browser test run twice before failing it.
    
    This is an optimization over @flaky - that ran the whole test again. This just runs the browser portion, so it avoids duplicate building.
    
    Standardizes the timeout to 60s. This should avoid more flakiness.
    
    Fixes the glgears_long test, apparently our bots now can reach only 20fps (not sure what changed there..)?

    Mark as flaky some graphics tests. These have always been flaky but recently the frequency of all 3 has increased a bunch. Could be the firefox update. (#9008)

    mark two tests as flaky (#8866)
    
    These seem to be common enough in recent runs to justify retrying.

    Wasm backend pthreads testing improvements (#8842)
    
    
     *   After #8811 landed a lot more tests can pass, this enables all those that can.
     *   Remove unnecessary stuff in test_pthread_gcc_atomic_fetch_and_op.
     *   Add more runtime assertions for the stack position.
    
    There are still a few tests that don't pass, so this doesn't close #8718. But they are quite few at this point (and look unrelated to stack issues - something else going on there).

    Enable some pthreads tests on the wasm backend path (#8715)
    
    Build more system libs with -mt.
    Test fixes.
    Misc minor JS glue fixes.
    Some tests still fail on odd things, I marked them as TODO - fix final pthreads tests,  opened #8718 to track that. There may be some serious issues there.

    Sockets fixes + testing (#7420)
    
    
    *    Add some missing stuff in deps_info.json which fixes #7417.
    *    Move the non-browser-dependent parts of the sockets tests into other, so that they run on CI.

    fix browser.test_pthread_sbrk - the test assumed each thread must see some allocation failures, but it is possible one or two will be lucky to run early enough so that their allocations all succeed (#7415)

    Get most chrome browser tests running (#7375)
    
    * use new KeyboardEvent(), as event.initKeyEvent was deprecated and removed from chrome
    
    * remove dump() calls
    
    * mark a test as no-chrome
    
    * add a mechanism to manually run a reftest, for tests that are async
    
    * xvfb fixes: show the log, and automatically find a port, so that another invocation during the emrun test succeeds
    
    * add some debugging code for browser tests
    
    * update sdl2 port to version_15, which brings in a fix for egl error reporting on context creation failure (which happens on chrome on ci sometimes)
    
    * browser test improvements: mark pthread_sbrk as flaky, mark two more tests that need a manual reftest trigger, and avoid creating an sdl2 renderer if we don't need one in some tests
    
    * more reference slack for browser.test_sdl2_gfx
    
    * mark browser.test_sdl2_mouse as flaky - the errors there appear to just be random weirdness on headless chrome's side
