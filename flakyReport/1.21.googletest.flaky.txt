    Googletest export
    
    The gmock matchers have a concept of MatchAndExpain; where the details of the
    matching are written to a "result listener". A matcher can avoid creating
    expensive debug info by checking result_listener->IsInterested(); but,
    unfortunately, the default matcher code (called from EXPECT_THAT) is always
    "interested".
    
    This change implements EXPECT_THAT matching to first run the matcher in a "not
    interested" mode; and then run it a second time ("interested") only if the
    match fails.

    remove doc of former versions
    
    The documentation of former versions is available in the history (e.g.
    by checking out the appropriate git tags), so there is no need to keep
    them in parallel to the current documentation.
