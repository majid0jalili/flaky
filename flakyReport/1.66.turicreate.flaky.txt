    Build System Improvements (#2835)
    
    This Commit introduces a significant overhaul of the build system with a focus on simplification and integration with proper CMake options.
    
    Improvements:
    
    All dependencies except openssl, curl, and libxml are moved into src/external and compiled as part of our source build. These dependencies are those needed for adding remote fs support, so compiling with --no-remotefs does not compile anything in deps/.
    
    CMakeLists.txt simplification. Now CMakeLists.txt is organized in a far more standard way. In addition, more logic is added to and moved to the ./configure script, as many cmake options that we were previously overriding with our own compiler flags work correctly when specified in CMake BEFORE the CMakeLists.txt file is loaded.
    
    More options in ./configure to support additional compilation options, such as listing out all source files used in the build or turning on or off various options.
    
    The custom model dylibs for iOS are now compiled using xcodebuild. XCode is supported as a generator for these models, which means that the compilation builds an xcode project, then calls xcodebuild to compile it. This allows better integration with the OSX ecosystem and should provide a way to resolve #834 easily.
    
    Source changes needed to support the above compilation and other internal dependencies. These changes included proper use of ARC globally, fixing all the size_t -> int conversions (int is 32 bit on some platforms, while size_t is 64 bit).

    Removal of cmake source code.
    
    This simply removes the source code.  It was disabled in an earlier commit.

    Upgrade for Curl + move LibBz2 into src/external. (#2097)
    
    As part of my attempt to get Turi Compiling on MacOS 10.15 beta, I upgraded curl
    This wasn't the problems, but this upgrade is useful (curl contains a
    number of bugfixes), so there's no reason not to adopt it.

    Upgraded coremltools; made it a dep that is much easier to upgrade. (#1501)
    
    * Moved coremltools into a much easier spot to upgrade.
    
    This PR also allows an alternate coremltools to be specified at
    configure time to allow for quick testing of new coremltools features.
    
    * Added coremltools to external dependencies.
    
    * Updated coremltools version.

    Updates packaged CMake to version 3.13.4. (#1432)
    
    * Updates packaged CMake to version 3.13.4.
    
    This enables the use of
    object libraries, which would substantially help the build process.
    
    Several GPL-ish files in the LexerParser directory had to be replaced.
    The log for how this was done is checked in.
    
    * Updated travis config.

    Upgrade Boost to 1.68.0 (#1187)
    
    * Add Boost 1.68.0, remove 1.65.1
    
    * Update Boost external project cmake
    
    * Fix some build errors
    
    * Replace GIL_FORCEINLINE with BOOST_FORCE_INLINE
    
    * Remove BOOST_FORCE_INLINE
    
    That no longer exists either
    
    * Fix for hang in non-space parser
    
    Otherwise, the new post-skip behavior is to get stuck in a while
    loop trying to parse while `first == last`.
    
    * Add back Boost date/time patch
    
    * Switch out Boost for Unix line endings
    
    I accidentally committed the version with Windows line endings earlier.
    
    * Turns out we need the `|| true` for incremental builds
    
    * Fix date/time patch
    
    Seems we no longer need part of it since it has changed in Boost
    
    * Fixed tuple conversion in variant_converter.
    
    * Fix build break from last commit
