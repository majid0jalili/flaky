    Add test fixtures for testing raster tiles
    
    Add a raster source for the style we use for testing that will
    force requests for raster tiles.

    Add MockFileSource and MockView for testing the ResourceLoader
    
    - MockFileSource
      Will load pre-defined resources from the filesystem. It supports
      passing a string, that when it matches an URL, will simulate a failure.
    
    - MockView
      It is just a no-op to not get in the way when testing
      resource loading.
    
    Few more additions:
    
    - style.json
      Specially crafted style that will look always for the same tile,
      glyph range, etc at the "test/fixtures/resources/" path. No matter
      where you look (or at what zoom), you always get the same stuff.
    
    - vector.pbf
      This taken from a part of Taipei that will request several glyph
      ranges.
