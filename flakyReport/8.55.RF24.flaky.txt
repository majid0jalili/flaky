    High Speed Data Transfers/Optimization
    
    Changes:
    
    - Enable PTX at radio begin, in standby-I mode
    - Enable PTX at radio stopListening(); in standy-I mode
    
    - Radio startListening
    - removed delay. What is there to wait for when the radio will just be
    listening anyway?
    
    - Radio powerUp
    - radio will need to be powered up after configuration
    - radio will not power down unless instructed to
    - need to issue radio.txStandBy(); when finished transmitting to engage
    standby-I mode
    
    - Added txStandBy() to drop to standBy-I mode if not switching to RX
    mode
    
    - Radio Write: Sped up
    - radio previously did not use standby mode effectively, after TX
    sending of each packet, the radio is
    powered down introducing a 1.5ms delay in addition to the 130us delay
    from standby.
    - No observe-tx code, a simple NOP cmd is sent to get the status info
    - No millis() timeout, hanging condition should only occur because of
    faulty code
    - Simplified whatHappened() code
    - Flush TX FIFO if MAX_RT met as lib does not support re-transmit
    instead of flush every time.
    - Remove ack size monitoring
    - No powerdown needed,
    
    - Added writeClear() function for writes that need the interrupt flags
    cleared (ack payloads, etc). Same as write() otherwise
    
    - Radio startWrite: Sped up
    - Enable PTX mode is now done in stopListening() code. Enter TX mode by
    writing CE high.
    This brings the data transfer capabilities up to a reasonable level
    - No need to power up, already in Standby-I mode
    - No need for delayMicroseconds() in write functon.
    - No need for delay after writing CE high
    - Does not enter Standby-I mode be default. It is up to the MCU to call
    the new txStandBy() function to enter standby-I mode from PTX if not
    switching back to PRX
    
    - Radio available:
    - Now checks the FIFO buffer instead of the interrupt flag (no missed
    data)
    - Moved clearing of interrupt flags to Read()
    
    - Radio read:
    - No longer returns any value - use available to check for more data
    
    - Radio isAckPayloadAvailable() now checks the FIFO directly
    
    - Radio getDynamicPayloadSize() - Per the datasheet, added fix to flush
    corrupted packets

    Made timeouts more explicit in write()
