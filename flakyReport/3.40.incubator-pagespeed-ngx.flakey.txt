    native fetcher: Support http keep-alive
    
    Based on @dinic his work, add keep-alive support for the native fetcher.
    Adds a new option, usable at the http{} level in configuration:
    
    pagespeed NativeFetcherMaxKeepaliveRequests 50;
    
    The default value is 100 (aligned to nginx). Setting the value to 1 turns off
    keep-alive requests altogether).
    
    Most notable changes:
    - Request keep-alive by adding the appropriate request header
    - Fixes connections getting reused while they are servicing other requests:
    - Remove connection from the pool of available connections for keepalive when applicable
    - Disable keepalive in more appropriate situations
    - Response parsing fixes
    - Remove connections that timeout from the k.a. pool
    - Add a few sanity (D)CHECKS
    - Emit debug messages for traceability
    - Fix for ignoring ipv6 addresses returned from dns queries when ipv6 is enabled.
    - Bump the fetch timeout in test configuration to deflake tests that require dns
      lookups (which will be done via 8.8.8.8 currently for the native fetcher)

    Valgrind: Add an automated test
    
    This makes nginx run in the background under valgrind,
    with both a master and a child process.
    Valgrind errors will be redirected to `valgrind.log`.
    When `USE_VALGRIND` is set, all system tests will be run under valgrind,
    and at the end a new test is appended which ensures no valgrind errors
    where encountered.
    
    It is also worth noting that:
    - There is a new file, `valgrind.sup`, which contains a few suppressions.
    - Some tests behave flakey under valgrind. For now these are appended
      to the expected failures (when under valgrind only).
    - 'Possibly lost' errors are all suppressed to get the amount of false
      positives manageable.
