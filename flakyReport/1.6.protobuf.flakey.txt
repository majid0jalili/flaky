    Travis config cleanups and move ObjC to Xcode 9.1.
    
    Stop having travis build the test matrix and make it explicit so extra
    settings are only on the test that need the, this helps make the travis
    UI a little cleaner (linux hosted stuff doesn't list an Xcode version),
    as well as avoid unneeded requirements limiting the travis pool something
    can run on.
    
    Small improvements to objectivec/DevTools/full_mac_build.sh to avoid some
    repeated scripting and hopefully make things more reliable work with Xcode
    9.x.
    
    Don't mark the iOS tests as able to fail, hopefully with the new settings
    they are stable and won't give false signals.
    
    Simplify the case for xcode versions and fixup xcode 9.[0-1].

    Mark iOS tests as able to fail.
    
    Travis updated their images to include an xctool that can randomly kill
    tests, so mark them as flaky to avoid turning things red.
