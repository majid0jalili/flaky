    Llvm38 (#112)
    
    * - Upgrade to official llvm 3.8
    - remove boost
    - unify all cmake files into a single cmake file
    - use official protobuf
    - start factoring out x86-specific stuff to eventually make an arm port easier
    - simplify the CLI; now use mcsema-lift, with -arch, -os, -cfg, -entrypoint, and -o. No more having to specify the target triple.
    - moves source code slightly closer to our style guide
    
    Note:
    - lifted bitcode is not quite right in some cases, so this isn't a stable branch!
    - TODO: re-add test cases to discover source of stability problems.
    
    * Some minor fixes, one to make sure xmm regs in the state struct are properly aligned
    
    * Added missing std defs for option parsing. This makes /bin/ls work properly :-)
    
    * Remove old cmake files
    
    * Minor changes to get_cfg.py and raiseX86.cpp in relation to those changes. Those changes don't fix anything, the purpose was to make symbol names for things match between python and cpp. E.g. get_cfg would name things like dta_0xf00, sub_0xf00, ext_... And it seems that it was dta_ instead of data_ for a reallly flaky and dumb reason but oh well. I also fixed a subtle bug related to saving and restoring of callee saved registers on elf 64. I have not made related changes to elf 32 or pe 32/64, though those may be necessary.
    
    * Minor fix
    
    * Adding mcsema-disass, which is a nice wrapper around get_cfg.py.
    
    * Working on readme and cleaning out (currently) unused stuff from the repo
    
    * Renaming mc-sema dir to mcsema
    
    * new travis file
    
    * Updates to bootstrap and build process
    
    * Minor bootstrap fixes
    
    * Well, don't have windows working yet but this is kind of progress I think
    
    * Travis should work now
    
    * Updating protobuf-cmake files so we can generate a VS2015 solution
    
    * Removing and adding some choco packages from README
    
    * Bootstrap now builds protobuf and generates protobuf files
    LLVM should now be built on Windows
    
    * Adding Win32 specific compiler options
    
    * Renamed ConstantInt to CreateConstantInt to satisfy MSVC
    
    * Build Release LLVM to not have linking conflicts of MD vs MDd
    
    * Added some missing instructions
    
    * Adding changes to generate runtimes
    
    * Windows bootstrap works.
