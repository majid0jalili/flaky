    psol: support a binary distribution
    
    We want people to be able to install ngx_pagespeed like any other nginx module.
    If PSOL were a full-fledged library with a stable interface we could simply say
    "install PSOL" which might be as easy as `apt-get install psol-dev`, but it's
    not.  Instead we directly include a precompiled binary library along with its
    headers.  By building the binaries on something sufficiently old (Centos 5.4)
    they should work pretty much everywhere someone might think to run
    ngx_pagespeed, but building from source is still a documented option if they
    don't.
    
    Headers and binaries are from trunk of r2338, as documented in the READMEs.
