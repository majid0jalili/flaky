    Tokimeki Mahjong Paradise - Dear My Love [David Haywood, Angelo Salese]
    Tokimeki Mahjong Paradise - Doki Doki Hen [David Haywood, Angelo Salese]
    
    changes:
    
    - split tmmjprd / tmpdoki from rabbit.c as it uses the graphic chip in a very different way, and having them together was making it more difficult to make progress on [David Haywood]
    - changed them to use custom rendering code instead of tilemaps, as they can address tile data at a sub-tile level, this fixes the girls in the intro [David Haywood]
    - added inputs [Angelo Salese]
    - added some notes about a hang, and possible reason [David Haywood]
    - marked the graphic roms of tmpdoki as BAD as it appears to be using tiles which are not present in the tmmjprd roms for the title screen [David Haywood]
