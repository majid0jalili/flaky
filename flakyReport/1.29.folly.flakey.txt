    Add AtomicReadMostlyMainPtr
    
    Summary:
    This is a ReadMostlyMainPtr variant that allows racy accesses. By making the
    write-side slower, the read side can avoid any contended shared accesses or
    RMWs.

    make the SKIP() macro report tests as successful
    
    Summary:
    The googletest framework does not have a built-in mechanism for skipping tests
    at run-time.  Folly uses a `SKIP()` macro for some tests to report themselves
    as skipped.  For our internal builds these are reported as failures with a
    special message that gets handled by our test runner framework.  However for
    open source builds it is better to report these tests as passing rather than as
    failing.
