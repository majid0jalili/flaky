    [fuzz] Added support for metadata frame to Http2Frame and h2 capture fuzz test (#12798)
    
    Commit Message: Increased code coverage of h2_capture_fuzz_test by including metadata frames in the Http2Frame utility class.
    Added utility functions to create metadata frames in Utility class. One of the additions supports taking a metadata_map and converting it into a byte string representing a metadata frame (logic based on source/common/http/http2/metadata_encoder). Added support for metadata frames in h2_capture_fuzz_test, which increased the line coverage of source/common/http/http2/metadata_decoder for this fuzz test by 86%.

    azure: rerun the flaky tests automatically (#12655)
    
    Added the build flag to enable rerunning the failed flaky tests as brought up by #12358. This is separated from the additional logic to post-process the test output to prevent rollbacks and improve quality of life of envoy devs.

    Windows: Enable direct_response_integration_test (#12772)
    
    - The test is flaky without performing socket shutdown
      - We know the content is fully written and the filter is a terminal
        one so we can enable the connection to be half closed and shut down
        the write end
      - Otherwise, the read in the client can get a connection reset error
        and on Windows may not have received all the data it should
      - See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-shutdown#remarks
        - `To assure that all data is sent and received on a connected
          socket before it is closed, an application should use shutdown to
          close connection before calling closesocket.`
    - Also enables route_fuzz_test and echo_integration_test as they now
      compile and pass

    test: ban RegisterFactory in most tests (#10645)
    
    * test: ban RegisterFactory in most tests
    
    Allows the integration test filters and clusters to be statically
    registered. Allows the registry test to perform static registrations.
    Otherwise tests should use the InjectFactory helper.
    
    Adds code format check for RegisterFactory and REGISTER_FACTORY used
    outside the whitelisted files. Removes use of both from all other
    tests.
    
    Also disables flaky test mode since we think the problems are
    fixed now.

    bazel: upgrade cc_configure.bzl for Bazel 0.5.2. (#1180)
    
    Previous cc_configure.bzl was somewhat stale, didn't provide required variable substitutions, thus
    breaking build.
    
    Explicitly disabled OS X and Windows build support with fail() messages indicating we need to
    revisit.
    
    Updated requirements to specify Bazel version.
