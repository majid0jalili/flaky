    xds testing: disable fail_on_failed_rpc check
    
    Fixing this needs further work to not share resources between tests.

    Fixed intermittent CPP sync server shutdown leak.
    
    Specifically: if a request handling thread is in flight but scheduled
    out when shutdown is called on the server, but it has already passed
    the shutdown check, then when it resumes it will add a grpc_call to
    the completion queue that is leaked. We fix this by explicitly freeing
    such calls after all worker threads have shutdown.
    
    To manifest the leak, run the end2end::ClientCancelsRequestStream
    test repeatedly on the unpatched server implementation. About 0.5% of
    the time, the leak will manifest.
