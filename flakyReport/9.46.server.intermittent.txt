    Add max_sequence_idle_microseconds
    
    This setting ensures that inference server resources are freed after a
    given timeout even if a sequence doesn't send an end marker. Without
    this timeout malicious or faulty sequences could DOS the server.

    Fix sequence scheduler to efficiently handle backlogs
    
    When all available slots are busy, sequences are kept in backlog
    queues and then swapped into batch slots as they come available.
    
    Add end-to-end testing for sequence batcher
