    tests: add an assorted variety of unit tests
    
    I'm mostly trying to make sure we have over-coverage for a couple of places that are being hit intermittently by our current unit tests, generating noisy codecov reports.  If we make sure these places are hit always, we hopefully won't have codecov misreport lost/gained coverage for unrelated changes.
