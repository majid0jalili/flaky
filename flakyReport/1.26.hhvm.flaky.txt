    Delete 3 scripts related to importing tests.
    
    Summary: We had some scripts laying around for importing spec tests, for finding files with non-ASCII characters in imported tests, and for fixing line endings in imported tests. We don't import tests any more, so delete these.

    Delete framework tests.
    
    Summary:
    The framework tests have been broken since pass-by-ref annotations became mandatory and return by ref became a parse error.
    
    Per conversation with Fred, we can't run composer, and can't fully run PHPUnit - these are unmaintainable.

    Do not automatically restart full checks cancelled because of IDE edit commands
    
    Summary:
    Here comes the big (?) disappointment of this diff stack: while we can do things during typechecking, the most important (?) and time sensitive sequence of IDE queries (edit + autocomplete) requires us to STOP typechecking (to apply the edit in thread safe way). We can do it, but there is a constant cost to starting and stopping those jobs, which can exceed the time Nuclide allots us to return the results and results in a very flaky experience.
    
    I tried a bunch of heuristics to try to automatically determine when to restart and none of them were particularly satisfying, so instead I opt to transfer this responsibility to the user - when you start editing files you cancel current recheck and it will be only restarted when you save any file again.

    Provide mechanism in repo to toggle into faked Watchman Event Watcher behavior
    
    Summary:
    This creates a mechanism for the repo itself to toggle the Watchman Event Watcher
    behavior (disable it and have it always spit out a fake "Settled" message).
    
    A bug was actually fixed in D5185200 which would result in log-spam until hard
    disk was full if a Hack client disconnected while it was in purgatory and the
    Monitor attempted to send it a message later (the summary for that diff doesn't
    mention fixing this bug - it fixed another bug - but it works). Purgatory usage was rare
    but becomes common with use of the Informant with a Watchman Event Watcher
    running.
    
    To avoid this, we need to disable the Watchman Event Watcher for older versions
    of the Hack server. Of course this isn't really possible by making changes to
    Hack itself. Here I add a file which acts as a toggle to enable/disable the
    Watchman Event Watcher. When disabled, all messages are faked into a Settled
    message instead.

    Watchman event watcher clients wait for notification
    
    Summary:
    Watchman event watcher clients wait for notification to
    indicate the repo has settled.
    
    Previously, only 1 message would be sent and the connection would be closed. If the message was not a "settled" message, the client would have to repeatedly create a new connection until the "settled" message. This makes things a little easier on clients - they don't need to repeatedly create new connections anymore. They can just select on the connection until a new message has arrived.
    
    Also added docs.

    Add PHP lang spec tests to HHVM test suite
    
    Summary: We have wanted to do this for a while, so now I am. These are
    the PHP lang spec tests. I used the PHP 5.x import script
    as a model to get the tests. But we don't have `good`, `bad`, etc.
    Instead we have a global `config.skipif` with the tests that are failing
    and we put a comment as to why they are failing.

    Overhauled xdebug remote debugging testing
    
    Summary: This diff does several things:
    * Moved remote debugging tests into a single folder (eliminates the need for a
      bunch of the same ini files)
    * Removed null characters as well as session-specific information from the
      output of the server before displaying. This means expectf files will now show
      up in phabricator, and most of the time out2expect.py is enough to generate
      a .expectf file
    * Changed remote_FOO.test -> FOO.php.test
    * FOO.test.in files can have comments now (1st character on line must be #)
    * Removed script status output, unecessary and it made writing expectfs a pain
    * FOO.php files are all the same now, just a single line. The testing file is
      determined automatically
    
    This was high-pri on my list of cleanup as the old way was awful and not very
    maintainable. I have most of the commands implemented and wanted this before
    I wrote tests.
    
    arc patch isn't happy with these binary files, but it's all just test motion and tests
    are passing, so...

    Implemented stating/stopping xdebug remote server
    
    Summary: This diff implements correctly starting/stopping the xdebug remote debug
    server, including initializing/deinitializing the dbgp protocol. The xdebug
    server supports all the configuration options available in php5 xdebug.
    
    A lot of this code started as the php5 xdebug code and so most of
    the flow corresponds 1:1 to php5 xdebug. However, the code was very heavily
    translated- all lines required some change of varying degree.
    So feel free to bug me about style/structure as my goal is to keep this file
    clean.
    
    What's missing is responding to commands. There are quite a few of these.
    Before that, I need to refactor the debugging hook code to work with non-hphpd
    debuggers.

    Migrate TestExtFile to php
    
    I dropped a couple tests that did nothing
    (e.g. clearstatcache) or almost nothing, or that 'tested' things that
    almost all the tests do (e.g. unlink or fclose).  Dropped a few unixy
    apis that really didn't test that they do anything.  Combined a few
    tests also.

    move compiled tests files into another dir
    
    I've been linking people to the README in this directory, but it is hard to see with all these files in here. What do people think about it moving a subdirectory? I don't love the name.

    delete most PHP in C++
    
    Sadly I can't get TestDebugger, TestServer, TestExt, QuickTests, or TestPerformance as they are all unsuported by verify. Someday.

    Code move src/ -> hphp/
    
    This change is mostly for FB internal organizational reasons.
    Building is not effected beyond the fact that the target now
    lands in hphp/hhvm/hhvm rather than src/hhvm/hhvm.

    Updated to the latest bits, fixed the cmake scripts so that hhvm compiles
    
    Summary: Added plumbing to the cmake scripts to enable hhvm builds.
    To build the VM, export USE_HHVM=1, and follow the wiki instructions
    to do a clean build.
