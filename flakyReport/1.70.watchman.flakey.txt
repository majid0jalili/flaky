    watchman: reduce flakeyness of test_sock_perms
    
    Summary:
    This often flakes out in our infra.  This commit increases a timeout
    for the expected failure case and allows for infra failures when testing
    invalid group names.
    
    I've also improved the debug output so we have more context if it does fail.
