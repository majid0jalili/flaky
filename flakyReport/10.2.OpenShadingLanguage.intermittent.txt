    Support for MCJIT
    * Link against MCJIT libraries from LLVM
    * Amend LLVM_Util to have a debug mode.
    * Some incidental movement of BackendLLVM methods from llvm_instance.cpp
      to backendllvm.cpp.
    * Some minor changes to LLVM_Util to support MCJIT.
    * Moved some non-essential (and unlikely to inline) functions from
      llvm_opt.cpp to other cpp files. This helps reduce the dependencies
      for llvm_ops.cpp, reduce the amount of bitcode to process, and was
      intended to fix some MCJIT issues.
    * Various fixes to make it all work, MCJIT seems a little fragile about
      predigested bitcode.
    
    Currently, this code uses ParseBitcodeFile rather than getLazyBitcodeModule
    when MCJIT is enabled, since MCJIT appears to have a bug that causes it to
    not correctly find the symbols in the module when using lazy deserialization.

    Defensive programming to be sure getcwd exists!
    
    In rare circumstances, we're hitting an assertion inside LLVM that can
    only happen if a call to getcwd() fails. This stupid bit of code is to
    try to catch it in the act and figure out exactly what's going
    wrong. Should not bother anybody not at SPI.
