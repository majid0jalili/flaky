    Work around a backup bug with DB custom checksums (#7294)
    
    Summary:
    On a read-write DB configured with
    DBOptions::file_checksum_gen_factory, BackupEngine::CreateNewBackup can
    fail intermittently, with non-OK status. This is due to a race between
    GetLiveFiles and GetLiveFilesChecksumInfo in creating backups.
    
    For patching 6.12 release (as this commit is intended for, except this is a
    forward-merged version), we can simply treat files for which we falsely failed
    to get checksum info as legacy files lacking checksum info.

    Disable DBFlushTest.SyncFail and DBTest.GroupCommitTest on Travis (#4154)
    
    Summary:
    I am temporarily disabling DBFlushTest.SyncFail and DBTest.GroupCommitTest tests on Travis until we figure out the root-cause. These tests will still continue to run locally though.
    I haven't been able to reproduce these failures locally so far (even on a [local Travis environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Troubleshooting-Locally-in-a-Docker-Image) ).
    
    These tests  are failing way too frequently causing everyone to wonder why their PR failed on travis, and waste time in debugging.
