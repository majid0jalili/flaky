    [core] Avoid GeoJSON source flickering on style transitions
    
    Before this change, all GeoJSON source cleared tile pyramid
    at the style transition and it caused flickering.
    
    Now, in Continuous mode, we keep the existing tiles until the
    new GeoJSON data is not yet available, thus providing smart
    style transitions without flickering.
    
    In other modes (Static, Tile) clear the tile pyramid in order
    to avoid render tests being flaky.

    [core] Render sources keep the existing tiles until the new tileset is ready
    
    In Continuous map mode, keep the existing tiles if the new tileset is not
    yet available, thus providing smart style transitions without flickering.

    [core] Avoid blocking in Thread<Object> constructor (#12151)
    
    * Introduce AspiringActor, EstablishedActor
    
    This pair of objects represents the two-phase (parent-thread /
    child-thread) construction that's needed to support constructing
    Thread<Object> without blocking until the child thread is up and
    running.
    
    An `AspiringActor<O>` is responsible for:
     - ownership of the actor's `Mailbox`
     - allocating the memory for (but *not* constructing) the target object `O`
    
    Using these two pieces--the mailbox and a stable address for `O`--an
    `AspiringActor<O>` can accept messages for the target object, or provide
    `ActorRef<O>`s that do so, before the object has actually been
    constructed by the corresponding `EstablishedActor<O>`.  (Such messages
    are queued in the mailbox until after the object is constructed.)
    
    This allows for an `AspiringActor<O>` to be created and safely used by a
    thread other than the one on which the target object will (eventually)
    live.
    
    An `EstablishedActor<O>` is responsible for managing the lifetime of the
    target object `O` and the open/closed state of the parent's `mailbox`.
    
    The `O` object's lifetime is contained by that of its owning
    `EstablishedActor<O>`: the `EstablishedActor` constructor executes the
    `O` constructor via "placement new", constructing it at the address
    provided by the parent `AspiringActor`, and the `~EstablishedActor`
    destructor similarly executes the `~O` destructor (after closing the
    mailbox). `EstablishedActor` should therefore live entirely on the
    thread intended to own `O`.
    
    * Remove Actor#{invoke,ask}
