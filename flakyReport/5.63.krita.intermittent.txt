    Move kritaimage to libs
    
    This shows up a bunch of other problems with alien includes. Some
    tests have been disabled (marked "kisdoc") because they needed
    kritaui.

    * Clean all #includes in headers
    * Remove all but two of the subdirs in krita/core in preparation for more
      file shuffling -- I will take Jesper Pedersen's lessons to heart and
      separate interface and implementation for core and plugins
    * Remove all necessity for plugins to include headers from the tiles
      directory (tested for performance consequences, the current scheme
      is even slightly faster)
    * clean up convolution by removing the old matrix class
    * clean up Makefile.am's by only linking with the necessary libs, not
      always with kofficecore and kopainter.
