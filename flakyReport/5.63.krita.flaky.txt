    Remove breakpad from git master
    
    We cannot handle the crash dumps from breakpad anymore, and breakpad
    hasn't been built for a year or so, so get rid of it for now.

    Add the google-breakpad crashhandler for Krita on Windows
    
    It is only enabled with with -DUSE_BREAKPAD=ON option. The default
    KDE crashhandler overrides ours unless you start krita with the
    --nocrashhandler option.
    
    It's a pity that we need to copy breakpad into our 3rd party
    source tree, but it seems that that is how breakpad prefers it...
