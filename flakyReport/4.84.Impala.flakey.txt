    Support for custom cluster configurations in some tests
    
    Test suites that derive from common.CustomClusterTestSuite have a brand
    new cluster for every tests case, which they can configure as they wish
    with custom arguments using the @with_args() decorator.
    
    A future improvement is to optionally only have one cluster per test
    suite, to allow multiple tests to run more quickly if they share
    configuration options.
