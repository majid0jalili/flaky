    [raft_consensus-itest] fix TestElectionMetrics flake
    
    This patch fixes flakiness in the RaftConsensusITest.TestElectionMetrics
    scenario.  The original TestElectionMetrics scenario was split into
    two parts TestElectionMetricsPart[1,2] to separate tests that assume
    no leader election happen and depend on the leader failure detection
    mechanism, correspondingly.
    
    Prior to this patch, the TestElectionMetrics scenario could fail if a
    leader election happened inadvertently.
    
    Before (1 out of 12 failed):

    After  (not a single failure in 1K run):

    KUDU-2274 [itest] stress test for replica replacement
    
    This is a stress test for the automatic replica replacement in Kudu.
    
    Parameters of the test are configurable via run-time gflags, so it's
    possible to run it in a 'standalone' mode, targeting it to be a sort
    of an endurance test.
    
    This test reproduces the race described in KUDU-2274: it triggers
    DCHECK() assertions added in 194fd8b169f29aafbd78a47709ac51d2e8354a1a
    before the relevant fixes for KUDU-2274 were checked in.
