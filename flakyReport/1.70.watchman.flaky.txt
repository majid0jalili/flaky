    disable flush_subscription test on Windows
    
    Summary: This test is quite flaky when running on Windows & heavy load. Let's disable it for now to unblock Watchman release on Windows.

    add retry flag to getdeps test
    
    Summary: This commit adds a flag `--retry` to getdeps and teach it to run retry failed test. This allows us to still pass the tests when there are some flaky tests presents.

    watchman: skip local saved state tests on ubuntu
    
    Summary:
    This is problematic on the lego-linux hosts for the same reasons that test_scm.py is.
    Skip it for now.

    Disable flaky test to make Facebook diff builds green
    
    Summary:
    test_scmHg is failing very frequently for Facebook's internal watchman-lego-linux-autoconf and watchman-lego-linux-cmake builds. Since those builds use `make integration` to run test instead of using Facebook's test runners, normal test infra doesn't handle the failures. This means that test_scmHg failures always appear in a diff's UI as the diff's fault, not as flakiness.
    
    Until we can investigate the cause of the failures, disable the test manually and make builds green again.

    enable retrying for nodejs tests
    
    Summary:
    I observed that we're not kicking in with the flaky test retry
    machinery and that this is causing travis to report some builds
    as failed.
    
    This diff enables retrying, and also allows for picking up `nodejs`
    from the PATH which is how my Ubuntu 16.04 system installs the node
    binary.

    Retry flaky tests
    
    Summary:
    Adds an option to the test runner that specifies how many times we
    should retry flaky tests.  This defaults to 2.
    
    We don't really know whether a test is flaky or not ahead of time,
    so this really just specifies how many times we'll retry a failing
    test.
    
    We'll only perform this retry behavior if the test instance has
    a method that allows setting the current attempt number.  We do
    this because most of our tests derive an output directory from
    the current test configuration; we need to augment that path with
    the attempt number in order for the subsequent attempt to be able
    to run in a clean environment.
    
    I've enabled this for python and php tests.
    
    A failing test will still print out its failure reason on each attempt,
    along with the current attempt number, but if it passes on a subsequent
    attempt, the overall test run status will reflect only its passing
    result.
    
    We could potentialy track a number of flaky tests and report it at the end,
    but I just want to get this in so that our OSS CI needs less manual poking.
    
    In addition to the above, tweak how we collect and report failing tests
    in travis and circle, so that we don't overwhelm their respective UIs with
    log data.
    
    I've also temporarily disabled the watchman java tests; we'll follow up
    and fix those, but I just want to get the CI into a default green state.

    watchman: adjust tests so that they can be run and collected by our internal CI
    
    Summary:
    The main thrust of this diff is to change our funky test matrix
    expansion with a differently funky way to expand the test matrix.
    
    The idea here is that we generate test classes for the various permutations
    of tests rather than re-using the same class and passing in parameters.
    
    This allows our internal CI system to keep track of the individual tests more
    easily.
    
    This is the same approach that we use in the eden tests.
