commit 47a5ed93feffb8744357cf114b164075077a336d

    Remove broken, unused support for `run.php --typechecker`.
    
    Summary:
    `./hphp/test/run --typechecker all` only ran 5 tests, they were all tests _of_ run.php, and they all failed. We are not seriously pursuing tyechecking of all our unit tests for now, so remove this unused, broken functionality (including not looking for expectations ending in .{typechecker|hhvm}.expect[f] any more).
    
    Also fix logic calling check_executable to produce proper error messages when the path doesn't exist.

    Delete framework tests.
    
    Summary:
    The framework tests have been broken since pass-by-ref annotations became mandatory and return by ref became a parse error.
    
    Per conversation with Fred, we can't run composer, and can't fully run PHPUnit - these are unmaintainable.

    Add call-time pass-by-reference annotations to test/run, make it hhvm-only
    
    Summary:
    The warning is now on by default, so the annotations avoid lots of
    spew. And since this is a Hack-only feature, change from <?php to <?hh. Then,
    since we can't have a single correct hashbang that works internally and
    externally, turn test/run into a bash script that finds an hhvm binary to use
    from a number of common locations.

    Add `--vendor` option to `hphp/test/run`
    
    Summary:
    We use hphp/test/run to test the docs.hhvm.com examples, including in `--typechecker` mode (which is not used elsewhere).
    
    We want to start using the HSL in these examples, which means we need to pull in extra code. Copying the HSL in is prohibitively slow - so:
    - for runtime, pull in `$VENDOR/hh_autoload.php` to make the definitions available at runtime without copying in or needing to re-parse
    - tell the typechecker to also pull in definitions from the vendor path
    
    Also, decrease the thread count for `--typechecker` mode as running it is basically burning my machine.

    Make OSS Test Script a real test runner - at least human runnable
    
    A bit of a redesign and better user-experience.
    
    This script runs one or more open source (oss) framework unit tests via PHPUnit. Run one or multiple tests by explicitly naming them at thecommand line, or specify --all to run all available tests. You will see various forms of output. The first time running a test suite for a framework, gray dots will appear to set the baseline for future runs. On subsequent runs, you will see green dots for tests that have the same status as the previous run. If something changes, you will see a red F if a test went from pass to something else. You will see a green F if a test went from something else to pass. You will see a blue F if a test stayed in the failing range, but went from something like E to I or F to S.
    
    The summary for a test show the overall pass percentage of the unit test suite, irrespective of previous runs. The output and diff files for a test suite will show what tests pass or fail, and have why they failed.
    
    Example output: P2777440
    
    Future: Add number of total tests to be run at beginning in a clean way; fbmakify the runner

    Write a script to help automate the running of PHP OSS Framework unit tests
    
    This is an initial verison of a script that will allow us to unit test all
    of the OSS PHP frameworks that we care about for parity. A more detailed
    summary is available at the top of the code, but here are some highlights:
    
    - Autodownload of frameworks; not added to our official repo
    - Mulit-process test runs
    - Full phpunit stats in a file after each run
    - Summary file for all tests run showing pass percentage. Appended with latest
      result for multiple test runs of a given framework. Initial inspiration for
      this file was for our MPK TV parity chart population.
    
    Future:
    
    - Integration with our "test/run" infrastructure
    - Special case frameworks that don't use PHPUnit
    - Enhance the script to allow "diff" stats that specify what changed from the
      previous run of a test of a framework to the current test (beyond pass
      percentage). For example, what tests caused the pass percentage to increase
      or decrease.
    
    New Files for this diff:
    
    - oss_framework_test_script: The script
    - phpunit.phar: Used to actually run the phpunit tests for each framework
    - composer.phar: Used for installing framework dependencies for phpunit
    - sample_multiple_test_config.cfg: A sample configuration file to run multiple, but
      not necessarily all testsi
    
    NOTE: I am only including 3 of the OSS frameworks as part of the code for this diff.
    When this diff is accepted, I will send out another diff with the rest added. Having
    just 3 makes for easier initial testing.
    
    Another note: I removed the comment that command_line_lib does not support options with
    arguments. It does. I am using that functionality in this script.
    
    THANKS TO @ptarjan for process ideas from both running the tests and getting through
    the proxy!
