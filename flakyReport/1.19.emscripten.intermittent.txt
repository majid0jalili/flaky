    Implement glfw joystick API (#5175)
    
    * Implement glfw joystick API
    
    Joystick connected/disconnected callbacks are called in
    refreshJoysticks(). The gamepadconnected/disconnected events are only
    used as a hint to refresh the joysticks, whose getGamepads() state is
    compared to the previous state to determine the new state.
