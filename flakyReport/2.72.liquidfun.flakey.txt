    Scripts to support automated builds of splash2d.
    
    The following build scripts have been added:
    * Autobuild/build.bat
        Builds all projects on Windows using Visual Studio.
    * Autobuild/build.sh
        Builds all projects on Linux and OSX using make and XCode respectively.
    * Autobuild/build_android.sh
        Builds all Android projects on Linux and OSX using the Android NDK via
        the build_apk.sh helper script.  This will generate an apk for each
        sample and unit test application.
    * Autobuild/build_android.bat
        Builds all Android projects on Windows under the cmd shell (cygwin needs
        to be debugged).  This will *not* generate apks for each sample or
        unit test application.  When the ndk-build is working under cygwin or
        build_apk.sh is ported to python the build of apks on Windows will be
        supported.
    * Autobuild/msbuild.bat
        Helper script which finds msbuild.exe to initiate Visual Studio builds
        from the command line.  This is used by build.bat.
    
    NDK makefiles have been modified to reference source files relative to each
    project's directory to workaround absolute source file references causing
    the NDK build on Windows to fail.
    
    Finally, run_tests_android.sh has been modified to execute correctly on OSX
    which uses bash 3.2 that doesn't support ${@}.
    
    Tested:
    Verified all scripts successfully build their build targets on Windows, OSX
    and Linux.  Windows build have also been successfully tested on one of the
    Android team's Windows build machines.
