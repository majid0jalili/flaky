    disable wait_for_alert test, since it relies on accurate wall-clock timings, which aren't necessarily possible on some CIs

    make disk_interface the customization point for storage, rather than storage_interface
    remove the disk cache
    remove trim_cache disk job
    remove zero-storage
    mark default_storage_constructor as deprecated
    remove storage_interface
    remove file_pool and default_storage_constructor. update connection_tester to use disk_io_thread.
    only ftruncate files once
    optimize hashing, by running sha1 directly on the memory mapped file
    use boost-multi_index in file_view_pool
    remove flush_piece and flush_hashed, simplify job-fence logic, remove prep_read_job_impl
    support noatime
    split out mmap implementation into a .cpp file
    support hashing of content in part files. wraps up new disk storage
    remove flush_piece disk job
    separate out store_buffer into its own class
    pass session_settings into storage operations instead of assigning a pointer in the storage object
    use unordered_map in store_buffer
    add fopen-based disk io back-end for non-64 bit systems or systems without mmap
    factor out open_mode_t into its own header
    first stab at windows memory mapped files support
    build all of boost for autotools
    remove flag in async_read callback handler
    remove old open_mode_t, preadv/readv and coalesce buffers
    support sparse and no_cache file flags in mmap
    Remove use of overlapped I/O because we're no longer doing any scatter/gather syscalls the use of overlapped is an unnecessary complication.
    don't explicitly specify global read and write. On MINGW we need to use libtorrent::read and libtorrent::write instead of the MINGW provided ::read and ::write.
    
    If the underlying file is empty then m_mapping is expected to be null.
    It is the caller's responsibilty to notice that the region's size is
    zero and not dereference it in that case.
    
    Otherwise there is no good way for users of default_storage::open_file
    to determine that the opened file is empty.
